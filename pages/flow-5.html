    <p class="text">Ending first semester with an exam, to showcase all we've learned thus far. We've been assigned to work on our portfolio again, this time on the other hand, do a complete makeover, and use what we've learned in the first semester. I took the constructive feedback i recieved, and in addition did a complete revamp of the site. Now with a better understanding of how things should look with 'designer' goggles, i could with ease figure out what i wanted, and why. <p class="text">The main changes, that ive been wanting to change are the following:</p><p class="text"><dl class="text">
	<dt><b>Frontpage</b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; I felt like the dark background as the frontpage, was too dark for my taste. Tried different ways to make it look 'artistic' or just personal in someway. With the second picture, i stuck with trying to go for the artistic look, but it honestly looked like too much was happening in the picture, which overwhelmed me. Since i went with the whole 'simple look', i decided to go with a rather simple frontpage too. Choose to have a gray background with a gradient white, for effect.</dd>&nbsp; <img class="image" src="../images/frontpage.jpg" alt=""/>
<dt><b>Color</b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; The first version didnt really had a color theme. it was all over the place with different backgrounds. Which made it look very unprofessional, and messy. I decided to go with plain white as the main color theme. Mainly because the color represents cleaniness and simplicity, and in fact it did make it gave the site a more professional look.</dd>&nbsp;
  <dt><b>From one-pager to multiple pages</b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; As mentioned in <a href="flow-2.html" target="new">flow 2</a>, i had a bit of a dilemma choosing what type of page i should be using. Now with more content to put in, and most importantly giving my navbar a purpose, i went from the one-pager to multiple pages.  </dd>&nbsp;
 <dt><b>Logo</b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; The logo wasn't mentioned for my initial feedback, although it did quite bothered me. Now with the new color theme, the logo looked out of place, and honestly quite outdated compared to the site's new astethics. Thats why i decided to give it a revamp also! Simple onelined black, with the sites name on it. Went for a more "tech/futuristic" look. Still not fully satisfied with it, eventhough its quite better, than the previous version.  </dd>&nbsp;
	<img class="image" src="../images/logotree.jpg" alt=""/>
<dt><b>Functional navbar</b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; I had a simple navbar orginially. nothing special visually and hover effects were minimal. Now i added more content for the navbar including a dropdown effect! hovering is smooth and most importantly it is fully functional. </dd>&nbsp; <img class="image" src="../images/navbar.jpg" alt=""/>

   <dl class="text"> <p class="text">I created the 'project' navbar in such way, that you can follow each flows chronologically.</p><dt><b><a href="flow-1.html">Flow 1</a></b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; We learned the basics of Photoshop, Illustrator, and Adobe XD</dd>&nbsp;
	  <dt><b><a href="flow-2.html">Flow 2</a></b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; Here we learned the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as hosting a site with Dreamweaver. With that knowledge, we then started working on our portfolio.</dd>&nbsp;
	  <dt><b><a href="flow-3.html">Flow 3</a></b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp;This flow we worked more on Illustrator, and started creating icons for applications. We also worked, what do keep in mind, when making an app (collecting data, user-tests, and knowledge on graphical icons in digital interfaces)</dd>&nbsp;
<dt><b><a href="flow-4.html">Flow 4</a></b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; Last flow, we got introduced to jQeury, and later on worked on making a website responsive (functional in mobile platforms) - With that knowledge, we began working with jQuery and making sites responsive, through a project called Hotbot. </dd>&nbsp;</dl>
