    <p class="text">In the first flow we're assigned to envision our portfolio, on this flow it was now time to make that portfolio a reality trhough coding. This time we're assigned to code and design a functionable website that would represent us.
    <p class="text">Wasnt quite sure whether or not i should go with a 'one pager' or multiple pages at first. My initial thought was to go with multiple pages first, but then ended up going for the one pager, due to the fact that i didnt have that many products/projects to present. <p class="text">You can check out the first state of the portfolio down below  </p> </p>

    <h2 class="title"> <span>What i had to work on &nbsp;</span></h2>
    <p class="text">The main point in my feedback, which i got for my portfolio was, that it was very limited. And i can fully agree. None of the buttons work at the time, which made the navigation bar pointless to have. <p class="text">Another point that was made at my portfolio, was that it lacked the products/projects from the previous work at the time. At that time i had thought, that putting some "fillers" in was and alright decision, since i had no idea we're to come back to this exact portfolio to later work on.</p>  </p>

    <h2 class="title"> <span>The updated version &nbsp;</span></h2>
    <p class="text">The updated version is the very website, that youre currently browsing. I took the constructive feedback i recieved, and in addition did a complete revamp of the site. Now with a better understanding of how things should look with designer goggles, i could with ease figure out what i wanted, and why. <p class="text">The main changes are the following:</p><p class="text"><dl class="text">
  <dt><b>Color</b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; The first version didnt really had a color theme. it was all over the place with different backgrounds. Which made it look very unprofessional, and messy. I decided to go with plain white as the main color theme. Mainly because the color represents cleaniness and simplicity, and in fact it did make it gave the site a more professional look.</dd>&nbsp;
  <dt><b>From one-pager to multiple pages</b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, i had a bit of a dilemma choosing what type of page i should be using. Now with more content to put in, and most importantly giving my navbar a purpose, i went from the one-pager to multiple pages.  </dd>&nbsp;
 <dt><b>Logo</b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; The logo wasnt mentioned for my initial feedback, although it did quite bothered me. Now with the new color theme, the logo looked out of place, and honestly quite outdated compared to the site's new astethics. Thats why i decided to give it a revamp also! Simple onelined black, with the sites name on it. Went for a more "tech/futuristic" look. Still not fully satisfied with it, eventhough its quite better, than the previous version.  </dd>&nbsp;
 <dt><b>Functional navbar</b></dt>
  <dd>•&nbsp; I had a simple navbar orginially. nothing special visually and hover effects were minimal. Now i added more content for the navbar including a dropdown effect! hovering is smooth and most importantly it is fully functional. </dd>&nbsp;
