    <h1 class="title"> Byg en app &nbsp;</h1>
    <p class="text">Halfway through the first semester, and so far its pretty much been all about the designing and coding for your website/portfolio. In the third flow, we're looking into working with apps, or more specificly designing a layout and functionality of an app.
    <p class="text">We're tasked to design a prototype version on a phone app, with 3 different themes to choose from. Those themes included: Weather-app, Real estate seeking app, or sports-tracking app. I ended up going for the weather theme for my prototype, as i had an idea to make it a bit original in sense of adding additional features, than what a weather app normally would. <p class="text">You can check the finished versions for phone <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/165b834a-1cac-426d-7029-c7bcdffb6476-606a/" target="new" >here</a>, and tablets <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/328b6f8e-771d-4822-4d6d-97f3a0a100ea-44ba/" target="new">here</a>. <p><img class="image" src="../images/handphone.png" alt=""/></p>  </p> </p>

<section class="emptyspace2"> <div class="container"> 
	<h2 class="title"> <span>Main feature &nbsp;</span></h2>
	 <p class="text">The main feature added to the weather app, is the "reminders" section. <p class="text">By choosing one of the 4 available options, the app will notify you with the best possible weather condition suited for the activity chosen.</p><img class="image" src="../images/handphone2.png" alt=""/> </p> </div>

	<h2 class="title"> <span>What to improve? &nbsp;</span></h2>
	 <p class="text">This project, can always be improved on.</p><p class="text">What it lacked in my opinion, was setting "faces" for my personas. Finding out who would need my product.</p> <p class="text">So adding some form of questions/setup, before the features of the app can be used. And i tought of adding a gamification element to it, so that the user would get motivated to add their interests, while also enjoying its features in the process.</p> </div>
