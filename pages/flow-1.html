	  <p class="text">In flow one, we were assigned, to create our own portfolio with Adobe XD. At this point i was really new to the world of webdesigning, so my expectations of this being a great website wasnt so great. I did however enjoy this experience, and definietly carried alot of the feedback i recieved onto future projects. <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/d0925992-3bac-4fae-59f3-0afc1f3a5171-a6a3/">Here</a> is how it originally turned out.  </p>

<p class="text">Not much was changed, although the changes was crucial. The fact that it said "Welcome to a Multimediadesigners portfolio" upon entering the site, is a bit dull. We clearly already know where we are, so a title about it is unnecessary. That was indeed my main critique for this project. What i also changed was the font from the font "OCR A" to "Segoe UI Symbol", mainly because it doesnt fit well, and at times can be a hassle to look at.  </p>
